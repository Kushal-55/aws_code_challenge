# wave_code_challenge

This repository contains my submission for the Wave Code Challenge.

##Overview:
In this challenge, I have developed a Python script to analyze weather data using the pandas, boto3, and requests libraries. The analysis includes retrieving weather data, merging it with station inventory data, uploading data to s3, performing calculations, and generating Excel files for further examination.

##Files:
main.py: The main Python script that performs the weather data analysis.
Station_Inventory_EN.csv: The station inventory data used for merging.
