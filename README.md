# aws_code_challenge

This repository contains my project to implement end-to-end data pipelines, covering extraction, transformation, loading, packaging, and deployment using AWS.

## Overview:
In this project, I have developed a Python script to analyze weather data using the pandas, boto3, and requests and several other libraries. The analysis includes retrieving weather data, merging it with station inventory data, uploading data to s3, performing calculations, and generating Excel files for further examination. I have also packaged the data into a docker image.
